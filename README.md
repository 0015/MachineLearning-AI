# 100 days of Machine Learning

This is the 100 days of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Optimization mini-projects that I picked up at the start of January 2022. I have used Google Colab for this work as it required various libraries and datasets to be downloaded. The following are the problems that I tackled: 

* GradCam Implementation on Dogs v/s Cats using VGG16 pretrained models
Cat prediction using GradCAM                                                                       |    Dog prediction using GradCAM
