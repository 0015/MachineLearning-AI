# 100 days of Machine Learning

This is the 100 days of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Optimization mini-projects that I picked up at the start of January 2022. I have used Google Colab for this work as it required various libraries and datasets to be downloaded. The following are the problems that I tackled: 

* GradCAM Implementation on Dogs v/s Cats using VGG16 pretrained models

Cat (GradCAM)          |  Dog (GradCAM)

* Multi-task Learning (focussed on Object Localization)

  1. GradCAM for Semantic Segmentation
  2. GradCAM for ObjectDetection
